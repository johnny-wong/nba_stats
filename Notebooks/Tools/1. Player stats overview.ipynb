If we can find a significant relationship between how much a player scores and the result of the game, we can capture deviations from the implied probabilities. Suppose in the case below, it seems like the probability that James Harden scores more than 25.5 points is significantly higher for wins that for losses.\n",

We can then either back the player and lay the team or vice versa (assuming there is a positive relationship). Although this probability can be reversed (working out team's odds based on player's odds), the spread for the team odds would be much tighter, and with more turnover, it is likely to be more accurate.\n",
