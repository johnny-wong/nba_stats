    "Sharp bookmakers use models to calculate odds and adjust them automatically. They offer lower spreads than soft book makers.\n",
    "Soft bookmakers are slower and more manual, but have wider spreads. They will also shut you down if you're too profitable. These are the ones that spend a lot on advertising, so are probably the ones you know best.\n",

    "Sharp bookmakers are hard to consistently make money from since their prices are very sophisticated. Soft bookies can have bad pricing due to their lack of speed, creating opportunities for arbs and value bets."

    "The whole point of this exercise, is to push my brain into innovating, instead of learning set methods well. For that reason, arbing isn't a good way to try and participate in sports betting. It is very well understood, rigorous, and time consuming. I am much more interested in value betting, finding odds that aren't fair, and developing models for my own odds."
